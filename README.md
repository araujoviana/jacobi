# Jacobi

A Python implementation of the **Jacobi iterative method** for solving systems of linear equations. The algorithm isolates variables, iteratively refines approximations, and checks for convergence based on a given tolerance.

## Usage
```shell
git clone https://github.com/araujoviana/jacobi
cd jacobi
python main.py
```
